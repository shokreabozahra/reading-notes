#  Logical operators:
##  There are three logical operators in JavaScript: || (OR), && (AND), ! (NOT) Although
## they are called “logical”, they can be applied to values of any type, not only boolean. Their result can also be of any type.


# for and while loops:
## while — loops through a block of code once; then the condition is evaluated. If the condition is true, the statement is repeated as long as the specified condition is true. 
## for — loops through a block of code until the counter reaches a specified number.
