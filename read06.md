# How Does CSS Work?
- CSS brings style to your web pages by interacting with HTML elements. Elements are the individual HTML components of a web page.
- CSS allows you to create rules that specify how the content of an element should appear.
# CSS Rules:
## A CSS rule is a grouping of one or more CSS properties which are to be applied to one or more target HTML elements.

## A CSS rule consists of a CSS selector and a set of CSS properties. The CSS selector determines what HTML elements to target with the CSS rule. The CSS properties specifies what to style of the targeted HTML elements.
## CSS rules have to be specified inside either a style element or inside an external CSS file.
